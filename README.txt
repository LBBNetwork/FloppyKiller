Some Beige-Box ancient history. Not really useful for anything; uploaded purely in the name of historical interest.
Floppy Killer 4.0 source code is not present because it never was intended to go open-source and well, we lost the source to it.

Certified working in QuickBASIC 4.5; may also work in later versions and Win32 ports of QuickBASIC.
