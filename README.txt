Some Beige-Box ancient history. Not really useful for anything; uploaded purely in the name of historical interest.
[strike]Floppy Killer 4.0 source code is not present because it never was intended to go open-source and well, we lost the source to it.[/strike]
We found the source code to Floppy Killer 4.0, as well as a few unreleased and unfinished relics of Floppy Killer 5.0 and the Floppy Killer 3.1 help system.

Certified working in QuickBASIC 4.5; may also work in later versions and Win32 ports of QuickBASIC.
